Sigma fp L with Lumix S 26mm f/8 Lens is my faviourite setup for street photography.

The camera and the lens are both small and light. This combination is perfect fit for [f/8 and be there
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F/8_and_be_there).

When shooting at 26mm, it has 61 million pixels. And the magic is with the crop zoom at 1.53x, you still got ~26 million pixels and a ~40mm focal length (which is my exquisite). It's like carrying both a Ricoh GR III and a Ricoh GR IIIx. :)

Of course, its write speed is not fast, so after taking a photo, you usually need to wait a while. This is a setup suitable for slow pace photography.

Find your peace.
